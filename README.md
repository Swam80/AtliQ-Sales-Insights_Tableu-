## Final Report
Based on the dashbaords insights, I have made some conclusions and recommendation that Sales Marketing team should/can consider making a sales strategy.

### Conclusions
* Sales were rapidly decreasing in 2020 compared to 2019 by around 57.7%.
* Highest revenue generated from Markets such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Nagpur, and so on where as Bangalore, Bubhaneshwar and Surat have been at all time low revenue generated marters.
* Highest quantities sold in the Market such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Nagpur, Kochi, Ahmedabad, and so on.
* Across the years, the top 5 customers have been Electrical SaraStores, Electricalslytical, Excel Stores , Premium Stores and Nixcoh.
* In terms of Profit Margin %, 2019 had the highest PM% at 3.12%
* Overall, eventhough Surat has been on the low revenue generation side, it has highest Profit Margin % at 4.86% on the other hand, Delhi NCR that has highest revenue generation has a PM% of only 2.3%.
* Bangalore has seen the worst market at profit margin of -20.78 %.
* In 2020, eventhough Delhi has given the most revenue, it was Bubhaneshwar who was the most profitable market at 10.48%
* Leader was the most profitable customer across the years at profit margin of 7.54% amd in 2020 Electricalsbea stores had highest PM % at 15.63%
* Product 001 and Product037 are top two with highest PM % at 39% and 38% respectively.
* Product 080 and Product 022 are bottom two lowest PM% with -35% and -30% respectively.

### Recommendation
* Considering 2019 and 2020, focus more on sales improvement in Lucknow, Surat and Bubhaneshwar as these have very low revenue. Especially Surat because it has lowest Profit Margin of Negative (-0.19%).
* Need to check costs of operations in Surat since loss have been incurred in 2019 and 2020 combined.
* Maintain good relationship with customers with overall high PM% like leader and in 2020, it was Electricalsbea. Maybe try giving them discounts?
* Make campgain strategy for mid year as they are showing high sales among other months.
* Even though, Delhi and Mumbai share top two spots for Revenue generation and Sales quantity, their Profit Margin % is pretty low. Need to revise additional costs or operations costs so that the profits can be maximised
